In 1970, at the start of his career, one of his outfits was selected by Vogue magazine as **Dress of the Year**. Two years later he formed his own fashion house, **Bill Gibb Ltd**, and launched his first solo collection to critical acclaim. His designs were applauded for their startling combinations of colour, texture and pattern. Collaborating with knitwear designer Kaffe Fassett, he created a signature style of layered knits for women. Gibb also gained a reputation for romantic grandeur, dressing celebrities such as model Twiggy and popstars Lulu and Cilla Black. He continued to design for private clients until his death.   \r    \r In 1997 his archive of sketched designs and swatches was bought by Aberdeen City Council: Museums and Gallery with help from supporters including the **Friends of Aberdeen Art Gallery and Museums**. We continue to add to the collection of outfits and accessories designed by Bill Gibb, and currently hold more than 100 items of clothing, plus numerous other items associated with him.   \r    \r To discover the full extent of the collection and see images search for Bill Gibb on the [Art Gallery Catalogue](http:\/\/www.aagm.co.uk\/TheCollections\/BasicSearch.aspx?dosearch=y&Artists=Gibb+Bill&Title=&chat=) (please note, all images are \u00a9 Aberdeen Art Gallery & Museums Collections).

By the early 1850s he was established in **Aberdeen** as an **artist and portrait photographer**. He received a contract to photograph the Royal Family, working for Queen Victoria and Prince Albert and was later commissioned to **illustrate Queen Victoria\u2019s diaries** of her time in Scotland when they were published. By the 1860s he was increasingly focussed on landscapes and stereoscopic views.   \r    \r This dataset is a list of all the items relating to **George Washington Wilson**, his company and successor companies, held by Aberdeen Art Gallery & Museums.

AQMAs must be designated officially by means of an 'order'.  The extent of the AQMA may be limited to the area of exceedance or encompass a larger area.  Following the declaration of an AQMA, the local authority is required to develop and implement a plan (Air Quality Action Plan) to improve air quality in that area. AQMAs can be for a combination of NO2, SO2, PM10.  Most data provided by local authorities is in polygon format. However, some is provided in point and line form so we are currently buffering such data by the width of a road or so in order to merge them in to the national polygon dataset. Some smaller local authorities e.g. Dundee, use the entire extent of their local authority, as digitised in Ordnance Survey's BoundaryLine dataset, for the AQMA.  We have included date of AQMA declaration in our national schema, though many LAs do not currently provide this.

An Article 4 Direction is not a conservation designation but an additional control within such areas. It is a statement made under The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Scotland) Amendment Order 2011. The Direction, made by a local authority and approved by Scottish Ministers, removes all or some of the permitted development rights on an area.  The effect of a Direction is that planning permission will be required for specific types of development which would otherwise be regarded as 'permitted development', i.e. development that does not require a planning application. Directions can cover a variety of minor works and might include: the replacement of doors and windows, the erection of gates, fences, garages, sheds, porches, storage tanks or the installation of satellite antennae.

Principal third party data suppliers include:  - Ordnance Survey (greenspace and water body data)  - Scottish Government (Scotland\u2019s Heat Map)  - Energy Saving Trust (Home Analytics)  Please reference the Data Guide and Methodology report (attached to the metadata record as an associated resource) and send any further queries on the quality\/ accuracy of the data to parkpower@greenspacescotland.org.uk.   GHiGs Settlements:   A public summary of indicators for GHiGs analysis of low carbon heat based on data aggregated to Scotland\u2019s 516 settlements. Settlement boundaries are from 2012 derived from National Records of Scotland to be consistent with those used by Scotland\u2019s Heat Map v.2. Settlements are defined as places with populations greater than 500. Approximately 90% of Scotland\u2019s population lives in settlements. It is not clear why Scotland\u2019s Heat Map is using the NRS 2012 settlement boundaries rather than the more recent NRS 2016 settlement boundaries. Attributes were derived from Scotland\u2019s Heat Map with additional attributes from GHiGs analysis and EST Home Analytics  GHiGs Settlements by LA:   A more comprehensive spreadsheet of tables used for National Findings Report and all indicators for GHiGs analysis of low carbon heat based on data aggregated to Scotland\u2019s 516 settlements and, separately, the 32 Local Authorities. Settlement data aggregated to Local Authority geographies and presented based on OS BoundaryLine Local Authority boundaries. The data excludes areas outside settlements and therefore does NOT represent figures for complete local authorities. This is particularly evident for Local Authorities with more significant populations and businesses located outside of settlements. It includes most indicators used in the GHiGs National Findings report based on analysis of low carbon heat related data aggregated to Scotland\u2019s 516 settlements and then aggregated to 32 Local Authorities.  GHiGs greenspaces:   Boundaries derived from OS Mastermap Greenspace. Attributes derived from Scotland\u2019s Heat Map v.2 with additional attributes from GHiGs analysis (see our Methodology Report) and EST Home Analytics  GHiGs strategic greenspaces:   Subset of GHiGs Greenspaces based on selection criteria to identify the 3% (3,446) of national greenspace sites with high potential for supply of ground source heat (based on areal size \/ capacity) and have been classified as \u2018high\u2019 based on local linear heat density. These sites are likely to be the strongest candidates for larger scale ground source heat solutions, potentially storing and feeding low grade heat into low carbon district heat networks. The \u2018GSHP_Strategic_Importance\u2019 indicator category of \u2018VERY HIGH\u2019 was used to select this subset  GHiGs static water bodies:   Relatively static water bodies greater than 1000m2 in area in proximity to urban settlements including canals, lochs, lakes, flooded quarries\/pits etc. derived largely from OS Mastermap Greenspace. This data does not include rivers.  GHiGs DHN highest viability (Linear Heat Density 16000 kWh\/m\/yr):   Linear Heat Density model created by Ramboll to highlight areas where District Heat Networks (DHNs) have highest viability based on heat demand from all buildings. Areas identifies have high levels of heat demand density and are therefore highly suitable for DHNs \u2013 source of heat demand data: Scotland\u2019s Heat Map v2.  GHiGs DHN high viability (Linear Heat Density 8000 kWh\/m\/yr):   Linear Heat Density model created by Ramboll to highlight areas where District Heat Networks (DHNs) have high viability based on heat demand from all buildings \u2013 source of heat demand data: Scotland\u2019s Heat Map v2.  GHiGs DHN viable (Linear Heat Density 4000 kWh\/m\/yr):   Linear Heat Density model created by Ramboll to highlight areas where District Heat Networks (DHNs) are viable based on heat demand from all buildings. Threshold of 4000 is widely used across the industry for Linear Heat Density modelling to identify areas with DHN viability. Polygons of area less than 250m2 were deleted which reduced the number of polygon features by 80% to cut file size. Source of heat demand data: Scotland\u2019s Heat Map v2.  GHiGs DHN highest viability public buildings only (Linear Heat Density 16000 kWh\/m\/yr):   Linear Heat Density model created by Ramboll based on a best estimate of public buildings to highlight areas where District Heat Networks have highest viable based on heat demand from only public buildings. Source of heat demand data: Scotland\u2019s Heat Map v2.  GHiGs DHN high viability public buildings only (Linear Heat Density 8000 kWh\/m\/yr):   Linear Heat Density model created by Ramboll based on a best estimate of public buildings to highlight areas where District Heat Networks have high viability based on heat demand from only public buildings.

GHiGs DHN viable public buildings only (Linear Heat Density 4000 kWh\/m\/yr):   Linear Heat Density model created by Ramboll based on a best estimate of public buildings to highlight areas where District Heat Networks are viable based on heat demand from only public buildings. Threshold of 4000 is widely used across the industry for Linear Heat Density modelling to identify areas with DHN viability \u2013 source of heat demand data: Scotland\u2019s Heat Map v2.  GHiGs public buildings:   Subset of Scotland\u2019s Heat Map at building level where buildings are assessed as likely to be publicly owned based on a selection of 125 OS AddressBase codes (see GHiGs Methodology report for details). This is the best available approximation of publicly owned buildings but will exclude those publicly owned buildings which are leased to third parties for more commercial-type services. This same identification method was the basis for creating the 3 Linear Heat Density map layers for public buildings only.

This dataset contains full details - where available - of site references, site size (hectares), capacity (in housing units), completions, remaining supply and annual forecast phasing over a period of years, also a record of past completions, including aggregations of 2009 and earlier and 2027 and beyond, where these have been grouped as such. Further details of greenfield\/brownfield status, tenure, effectiveness (deliverable within the period), constraints, planning details\/status and developer are also provided where available.  The datasets have been drawn from a variety of sources, including comprehensive regional datasets (ClydePlan) and the joining of spatial and tabular data. This includes allocated and planned sites, which typically have fuller details of forecast phasing (etc) and also \"windfall\" and small sites (where included), which may be one-off rather than longer-term developments, with less detail. Some of these sites lack spatial geometry and have been represented by a square buffer on a recorded X\/Y easting\/northing, based on site size, if this information is available.","Source":"ckan API","AssetStatus":null,"ODSCategories":"Food and Environment;Housing and Estates;Planning and Development","ODSCategories_Keywords":{"Food and Environment":["land"],"Housing and Estates":["housing"],"Planning and Development":["housing","land audit","local development plan","planning"]}},{"Title":"Housing Land Supply - North Ayrshire","Owner":"North Ayrshire Council","PageURL":" https:\/\/data.spatialhub.scot\/dataset\/housing_land_supply-na","AssetURL":"https:\/\/www.maps.north-ayrshire.gov.uk\/arcgis\/services\/AGOL\/Spatial_Hub\/MapServer\/WFSServer?request=GetCapabilities&service=WFS","FileName":"Spatial Hub WFS","DateCreated":"2016-05-24T00:00:00.000","DateUpdated":"2022-10-27T00:00:00.000","FileSize":null,"FileSizeUnit":"B","FileType":"No file type","NumRecords":null,"OriginalTags":"environment;planning","ManualTags":"","License":"Open Government Licence v3.0","Description":"Local authorities are required to conduct an annual survey of the housing land supply, 'the Housing Land Audit', to determine completions within the timeframe and update forecasts of the housing land supply.

Development plans set out the long term vision for where development should and shouldn\u2019t happen in the places they cover. The local development plan is the principal land use planning document used in assessing applications for planning permission, based upon national, regional and local policies and proposals. It is the most significant material consideration in determining such applications and reference to the local development plan is essential for most types of proposed development. The main spatial element is typically the policies and proposals map, which is created from the data that is also used in this dataset. Some policies will be plan-wide, and not reproduced spatially, so this dataset contains policy data that is linked to a discrete area within the planning authority area.   In addition to the local development plan, reference should be made to the National Planning Framework (covering all of Scotland), the Strategic Development Plan (where applicable) and supplementary guidance that is included in the development plan.   Update and reference to other datasets  This dataset will be updated as and when development plans are replaced and formally adopted by authorities, on a minimum quarterly basis in operational terms each year.

In this case, the tags may well have null values.   This is an early release of the dataset, which will change further following consultation with users, planning authorities and other stakeholders.

LEZs are based on a penalty notice approach to effectively ban non-compliant vehicles.","Source":"ckan API","AssetStatus":null,"ODSCategories":"Business and Economy;Council and Government;Food and Environment","ODSCategories_Keywords":{"Business and Economy":["pollution"],"Council and Government":["council"],"Food and Environment":["air quality","emissions","pollution"]}},{"Title":"Low Emission Zones - Scotland","Owner":"Improvement Service","PageURL":" https:\/\/data.spatialhub.scot\/dataset\/low_emission_zones-is","AssetURL":"https:\/\/geo.spatialhub.scot\/geoserver\/sh_lez\/wfs?service=wfs&typeName=sh_lez:pub_lez","FileName":"Low Emission Zones ","DateCreated":"2022-09-29T00:00:00.000","DateUpdated":"2022-11-01T00:00:00.000","FileSize":null,"FileSizeUnit":"B","FileType":"WFS","NumRecords":null,"OriginalTags":"environment","ManualTags":"","License":"Custom licence: Other (Not Open)","Description":"Low Emission Zones (LEZs) are designed to improve air quality and were introduced across Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow on 31 May 2022.

Scotland had a great tradition of publishing descriptive (long-form) gazetteers in the 19th century.   This dataset is the GIS point format output from a project funded by the Scottish Government in the early 2010s, to create a Definitive Place-Name Gazetteer for Scotland, which helped meet the INSPIRE requirements for a place-name layer. The data also forms the underlying content for the Gazetteer for Scotland web pages: https:\/\/www.scottish-places.info\/   In 2009 a workshop was run in conjunction with the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historic Monuments of Scotland (RCAHMS) to examine the range of gazetteers in use in Scotland, together with a broad set of requirements. This identified a number of organisations which hold or maintain at least 15 different gazetteers that include geographical names for Scotland. The two most significant gazetteers were the Gazetteer for Scotland and the Ordnance Survey 1:50000 (OS 1:50K) product \u2013 which forms the basis for this dataset.   The Gazetteer for Scotland is a descriptive gazetteer, with a modest number (22,000) of rich entries, including a textual description and rich feature-typing. The OS 1:50K gazetteer has long been Ordnance Survey's only place-name gazetteer, used as part of numerous applications.  It was decided that, for this new 'definitive' place name gazetteer, any named feature could\/ should potentially be included, but it was accepted that the list will always be incomplete.   This dataset could be used (and potentially linked with) other datasets like the One Scotland Gazetteer and the Historical Names gazetteer.  The methodology for this data was a combination of automated and manual editing. Automated methods were used in feature classification and duplicate detection. Manual editing was required both to confirm or provide a feature classification, but also to improve the spatial referencing.  Standards had to be adopted; for example water bodies were spatially located by a point which approximated its centre while rivers were spatially located at their termination and other liner features by a random point along their length. The former gives a useful spatial reference, the latter in many cases does not.  Quality checking suggests that 95% of points were located to 100m or better, and 5% located to 20m or better. More than 90% of features are classified correctly, on the basis of the evidence available","Source":"ckan API","AssetStatus":null,"ODSCategories":"Arts \/ Culture \/ History;Budget \/ Finance;Food and Environment","ODSCategories_Keywords":{"Arts \/ Culture \/ History":["gazetteer","gazetteers"],"Budget \/ Finance":["funded"],"Food and Environment":["rivers"]}},{"Title":"Planning Applications - Scotland","Owner":"Improvement Service","PageURL":" https:\/\/data.spatialhub.scot\/dataset\/planning_applications-is","AssetURL":"https:\/\/geo.spatialhub.scot\/geoserver\/sh_plapp\/wfs?service=wfs&typeName=sh_plapp:pub_plappweekpnt","FileName":"Planning Applications: Weekly Lists (Points)","DateCreated":"2021-06-11T00:00:00.000","DateUpdated":"2023-03-22T00:00:00.000","FileSize":null,"FileSizeUnit":"B","FileType":"WFS","NumRecords":null,"OriginalTags":"environment;planning","ManualTags":"","License":"Custom licence: Other (Not Open)","Description":"'Development management' is the name given to the process of deciding planning applications and various other associated activities including enforcement of planning controls.

Planning Applications - Weekly Lists (Points):\u00a0\u00a0A point layer showing an amalgamation of the current calendar year's weekly lists for all Scottish planning authorities in terms of applications registered and\/or decided by a planning authority. This should be a complete dataset across Scotland using X\/Y co-ordinates, UPRN or postcode as corresponding\u00a0geometry. This is categorised by application status, planning authority and date of weekly list. 2. Planning Applications - Weekly Lists (Polygons):\u00a0A polygon layer showing an amalgamation of the current calendar year's weekly lists for most Scottish\u00a0planning\u00a0authorities in terms of\u00a0applications registered and\/or decided by a planning authority. This is only for authorities that publish site boundary\u00a0mapping data online.\u00a0This is\u00a0categorised\u00a0by application status, planning authority and date of weekly list. 3. Planning Applications - historic year data back to 1990 (Points):\u00a0A Point layer for all previous year's planning applications with summary details for\u00a0most\u00a0Scottish\u00a0planning\u00a0authorities. This is only for authorities that publish site boundary\u00a0mapping data online and is not complete across Scotland. NB. This layer can be filtered for individual year by selecting the 'shapefile' or 'GeoJSON' download option or the Web Feature Service can be filtered using appropriate software such as a desktop GIS. 4.

This data is collected and published weekly (for weekly lists) and this metadata record is updated weekly.  We strongly recommend that, when using the WFS for this dataset, because of it's size you should use it with a filter.  *Moray's planning data has currently been removed from this dataset.

The dataset is created under the provisions as listed within The Town and Country Planning (Tree Preservation Order and Trees in Conservation Areas) (Scotland) Regulations 2010. Spatial and attribute data is maintained in ArcMap shapefile with extra attributes in a spreadsheet (including link to TPO PDF). Planning technicians ensure that data is updated regularly once new information about a TPO is provided, a new TPO is registered or a TPO has been removed. The conservation officers or senior management advise and direct planning technicians to create a draft TPO location plan which is then sent to the paralegal team. The paralegals then carry out their duties in confirming and registering the TPO and informing any interested party. The planning technician then updates the spatial data in ArcMap which, once finalised, is then sent to GIS staff to update into Location Centre. The data will be of interest to staff within PKC who are interested in identifying or collecting TPO data for their own professional purposes e.g. Development Management (planning application, LDP , supplementary guidance) and Greenspace (maintenance and retention of natural assets). The dataset is available for general public use, stakeholders or any interested party outside the Council to identify TPOs.","Source":"ckan API","AssetStatus":null,"ODSCategories":"Council and Government;Elections \/ Politics;Food and Environment;Law and Licensing;Planning and Development","ODSCategories_Keywords":{"Council and Government":["council"],"Elections \/ Politics":["local authority"],"Food and Environment":["preservation","tree","tree preservation order"],"Law and Licensing":["regulations"],"Planning and Development":["planning"]}},{"Title":"Tree Preservation Orders - South Ayrshire","Owner":"South Ayrshire Council","PageURL":" https:\/\/data.spatialhub.scot\/dataset\/tree_preservation_orders-sa","AssetURL":"https:\/\/gisext.south-ayrshire.gov.uk\/server\/services\/Inspire\/OpenData\/MapServer\/WFSServer","FileName":"Tree Preservation Orders","DateCreated":"2017-01-27T00:00:00.000","DateUpdated":"2023-01-26T00:00:00.000","FileSize":null,"FileSizeUnit":"B","FileType":"No file type","NumRecords":null,"OriginalTags":"environment;planning","ManualTags":"","License":"Open Government Licence v3.0","Description":"*Whilst TPOs are a legal requirement they may not always be digitised accurately.

Since December 1997 each local authority in the UK has been carrying out a review and assessment of air quality in their area. This involves measuring air pollution and trying to predict how it will change in the next few years.

These tenure estimates were last undertaken for housing stock as it was in 2018, with the report going to Council committee in 2019.
