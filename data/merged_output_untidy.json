AQMAs must be designated officially by means of an 'order'.  The extent of the AQMA may be limited to the area of exceedance or encompass a larger area.  Following the declaration of an AQMA, the local authority is required to develop and implement a plan (Air Quality Action Plan) to improve air quality in that area. AQMAs can be for a combination of NO2, SO2, PM10.  Most data provided by local authorities is in polygon format. However, some is provided in point and line form so we are currently buffering such data by the width of a road or so in order to merge them in to the national polygon dataset. Some smaller local authorities e.g. Dundee, use the entire extent of their local authority, as digitised in Ordnance Survey's BoundaryLine dataset, for the AQMA.  We have included date of AQMA declaration in our national schema, though many LAs do not currently provide this.

An Article 4 Direction is not a conservation designation but an additional control within such areas. It is a statement made under The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Scotland) Amendment Order 2011. The Direction, made by a local authority and approved by Scottish Ministers, removes all or some of the permitted development rights on an area.  The effect of a Direction is that planning permission will be required for specific types of development which would otherwise be regarded as 'permitted development', i.e. development that does not require a planning application. Directions can cover a variety of minor works and might include: the replacement of doors and windows, the erection of gates, fences, garages, sheds, porches, storage tanks or the installation of satellite antennae.

The management and remediation of contaminated land that, in its current state, is causing or has the potential to cause significant harm or significant pollution of the water environment, is regulated by legislation and underpinned by the core principles of the 'polluter pays' and a 'suitable for use approach'.  Local authorities are the primary regulator for the contaminated land regime (SEPA also has certain responsibilities within the scope of the legislation) to regulate activities and assist in the management and remediation of contaminated land.  Contaminated Land can go through remediation work and this dataset attempts to collect that detail. However, when a site has been remediated, it becomes suitable for the current use (at the time of remediation), and that this doesn't mean the site is 'clean' or has no contamination.  Further assessment\/remediation may be required should there be any change of use or new planning application etc.  The current regulation regarding Contaminated Land is contained within the  Environmental Protection Act (1990) known as Part IIA. Part IIA is further established in Scotland by the Contaminated Land (Scotland) Regulations 2000 (SSI 2000\/178), as amended and the Scottish Government\u2019s Statutory Guidance: Edition 2 provides the detailed framework for the definition, identification and remediation of contaminated land.

Attributes derived from Scotland\u2019s Heat Map v.2 with additional attributes from GHiGs analysis (see our Methodology Report) and EST Home Analytics  GHiGs strategic greenspaces:   Subset of GHiGs Greenspaces based on selection criteria to identify the 3% (3,446) of national greenspace sites with high potential for supply of ground source heat (based on areal size \/ capacity) and have been classified as \u2018high\u2019 based on local linear heat density. These sites are likely to be the strongest candidates for larger scale ground source heat solutions, potentially storing and feeding low grade heat into low carbon district heat networks. The \u2018GSHP_Strategic_Importance\u2019 indicator category of \u2018VERY HIGH\u2019 was used to select this subset  GHiGs static water bodies:   Relatively static water bodies greater than 1000m2 in area in proximity to urban settlements including canals, lochs, lakes, flooded quarries\/pits etc. derived largely from OS Mastermap Greenspace. This data does not include rivers.  GHiGs DHN highest viability (Linear Heat Density 16000 kWh\/m\/yr):   Linear Heat Density model created by Ramboll to highlight areas where District Heat Networks (DHNs) have highest viability based on heat demand from all buildings. Areas identifies have high levels of heat demand density and are therefore highly suitable for DHNs \u2013 source of heat demand data: Scotland\u2019s Heat Map v2.  GHiGs DHN high viability (Linear Heat Density 8000 kWh\/m\/yr):   Linear Heat Density model created by Ramboll to highlight areas where District Heat Networks (DHNs) have high viability based on heat demand from all buildings \u2013 source of heat demand data: Scotland\u2019s Heat Map v2.  GHiGs DHN viable (Linear Heat Density 4000 kWh\/m\/yr):   Linear Heat Density model created by Ramboll to highlight areas where District Heat Networks (DHNs) are viable based on heat demand from all buildings. Threshold of 4000 is widely used across the industry for Linear Heat Density modelling to identify areas with DHN viability. Polygons of area less than 250m2 were deleted which reduced the number of polygon features by 80% to cut file size. Source of heat demand data: Scotland\u2019s Heat Map v2.  GHiGs DHN highest viability public buildings only (Linear Heat Density 16000 kWh\/m\/yr):   Linear Heat Density model created by Ramboll based on a best estimate of public buildings to highlight areas where District Heat Networks have highest viable based on heat demand from only public buildings. Source of heat demand data: Scotland\u2019s Heat Map v2.  GHiGs DHN high viability public buildings only (Linear Heat Density 8000 kWh\/m\/yr):   Linear Heat Density model created by Ramboll based on a best estimate of public buildings to highlight areas where District Heat Networks have high viability based on heat demand from only public buildings. Source of heat demand data: Scotland\u2019s Heat Map v2.  GHiGs DHN viable public buildings only (Linear Heat Density 4000 kWh\/m\/yr):   Linear Heat Density model created by Ramboll based on a best estimate of public buildings to highlight areas where District Heat Networks are viable based on heat demand from only public buildings. Threshold of 4000 is widely used across the industry for Linear Heat Density modelling to identify areas with DHN viability \u2013 source of heat demand data: Scotland\u2019s Heat Map v2.  GHiGs public buildings:   Subset of Scotland\u2019s Heat Map at building level where buildings are assessed as likely to be publicly owned based on a selection of 125 OS AddressBase codes (see GHiGs Methodology report for details). This is the best available approximation of publicly owned buildings but will exclude those publicly owned buildings which are leased to third parties for more commercial-type services. This same identification method was the basis for creating the 3 Linear Heat Density map layers for public buildings only.  GHiGs public buildings with heat demand greater than 50 MWh\/year:  Subset of \u2018GHiGs public buildings\u2019 dataset based on a filter for all those public buildings with an annual heat demand of 50 MWh or more. Multi-occupancy buildings like flatted properties are treated as separate buildings and therefore they are unlikely to appear in this dataset.  GHiGs public buildings (>200 MWh) near greenspaces (>200 MWh):  Subset of \u2018GHiGs public buildings\u2019 dataset where: (1) buildings are assessed as likely to be publicly owned based on a selection of 125 OS AddressBase codes and have a heat demand of at least 200 MWh; AND (2) they are located within 50m of a greenspace that, based on 20% space utilisation, could meet at least 200 MWh in terms of heat production from its available area. In effect this is a subset of public building locations that offers the strongest opportunities for larger scale GSHP projects based on use of nearby greenspace. Multi-occupancy buildings like flatted properties are treated as separate buildings and therefore examples such as high rise flats next to larger areas of greenspace are unlikely to appear in this dataset.  GHiGs waste disposal sites:  Potential sources of waste heat from waste disposal sites to feed into district heat networks \u2013 source: SEPA registered waste sites   All GHiGs datasets cover Scotland and have been derived over the project period of September 2020 to April 2021.

This includes allocated and planned sites, which typically have fuller details of forecast phasing (etc) and also \"windfall\" and small sites (where included), which may be one-off rather than longer-term developments, with less detail.

In addition to the local development plan, reference should be made to the National Planning Framework (covering all of Scotland), the Strategic Development Plan (where applicable) and supplementary guidance that is included in the development plan.

This will also be resolved, in data architecture terms, through dialogue with these key agencies.  Geometries  There are three layers within this dataset, for point, polyline and polygon features. Not all authorities capture all three feature types.   Categorisation  The dataset employs three levels of categorisation \u2013 class, subclass and tags. The classes and subclasses are listed below, based on a particular data attribute field that originates in the dataset and is mapped to the common attribute \u201clayer type\u201d which is then searched for an applicable match. Tags are used in searches to match and categorise dataset features against the layer type, and captured as a full list of tags against each feature to allow multi-criteria searches.  Known Issues  Some manual classification is required, for features that have only a reference or a layer name that needs direct matching to a class and subclass. In this case, the tags may well have null values.   This is an early release of the dataset, which will change further following consultation with users, planning authorities and other stakeholders. In the longer term, a move towards common standards and categorisation will be promoted.

Tags are used in searches to match and categorise dataset features against the layer type, and captured as a full list of tags against each feature to allow multi-criteria searches.  Known Issues  Some manual classification is required, for features that have only a reference or a layer name that needs direct matching to a class and subclass. In this case, the tags may well have null values.   This is an early release of the dataset, which will change further following consultation with users, planning authorities and other stakeholders. In the longer term, a move towards common standards and categorisation will be promoted.

The Local Development Plan dataset is a composition of Local Development Plans supplied by local authorities and national parks in Scotland. It is intended to provide a spatial overview of common policies across Scotland. The authoritative data source is the originating data supplied by the planning authority and the authoritative plan is that which is published as approved and adopted by the planning authority, which may not be in a digital format.   Development plans set out the long term vision for where development should and shouldn\u2019t happen in the places they cover. The local development plan is the principal land use planning document used in assessing applications for planning permission, based upon national, regional and local policies and proposals. It is the most significant material consideration in determining such applications and reference to the local development plan is essential for most types of proposed development. The main spatial element is typically the policies and proposals map, which is created from the data that is also used in this dataset. Some policies will be plan-wide, and not reproduced spatially, so this dataset contains policy data that is linked to a discrete area within the planning authority area.   In addition to the local development plan, reference should be made to the National Planning Framework (covering all of Scotland), the Strategic Development Plan (where applicable) and supplementary guidance that is included in the development plan.   Update and reference to other datasets  This dataset will be updated as and when development plans are replaced and formally adopted by authorities, on a minimum quarterly basis in operational terms each year. Local development plans are currently replaced on a five year basis and will be further modified by the forthcoming Planning Act, likely moving to a ten year cycle with interim updates, although it is not yet clear on how updates will be prepared. If proposed and draft plans (and other datasets, such as issues reports) are published on the Spatial Hub, this will be as a separate dataset.   This dataset should be used in conjunction with other planning related datasets available on the Spatial Hub, notably planning applications, conservation areas, housing land and employment land. There may be some duplication with related layers, due to the ways that particular authorities may share data, and this will be resolved on a layer-by-layer basis as this dataset (and others) are developed. This is also true for some national datasets, such as statutory designations for natural heritage: these typically originate with other agencies although they are often published as part of a local development plan. This will also be resolved, in data architecture terms, through dialogue with these key agencies.  Geometries  There are three layers within this dataset, for point, polyline and polygon features. Not all authorities capture all three feature types.   Categorisation  The dataset employs three levels of categorisation \u2013 class, subclass and tags. The classes and subclasses are listed below, based on a particular data attribute field that originates in the dataset and is mapped to the common attribute \u201clayer type\u201d which is then searched for an applicable match. Tags are used in searches to match and categorise dataset features against the layer type, and captured as a full list of tags against each feature to allow multi-criteria searches.  Known Issues  Some manual classification is required, for features that have only a reference or a layer name that needs direct matching to a class and subclass. In this case, the tags may well have null values.   This is an early release of the dataset, which will change further following consultation with users, planning authorities and other stakeholders. In the longer term, a move towards common standards and categorisation will be promoted.

Scotland had a great tradition of publishing descriptive (long-form) gazetteers in the 19th century.   This dataset is the GIS point format output from a project funded by the Scottish Government in the early 2010s, to create a Definitive Place-Name Gazetteer for Scotland, which helped meet the INSPIRE requirements for a place-name layer. The data also forms the underlying content for the Gazetteer for Scotland web pages: https:\/\/www.scottish-places.info\/   In 2009 a workshop was run in conjunction with the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historic Monuments of Scotland (RCAHMS) to examine the range of gazetteers in use in Scotland, together with a broad set of requirements. This identified a number of organisations which hold or maintain at least 15 different gazetteers that include geographical names for Scotland. The two most significant gazetteers were the Gazetteer for Scotland and the Ordnance Survey 1:50000 (OS 1:50K) product \u2013 which forms the basis for this dataset.   The Gazetteer for Scotland is a descriptive gazetteer, with a modest number (22,000) of rich entries, including a textual description and rich feature-typing. The OS 1:50K gazetteer has long been Ordnance Survey's only place-name gazetteer, used as part of numerous applications.  It was decided that, for this new 'definitive' place name gazetteer, any named feature could\/ should potentially be included, but it was accepted that the list will always be incomplete.   This dataset could be used (and potentially linked with) other datasets like the One Scotland Gazetteer and the Historical Names gazetteer.  The methodology for this data was a combination of automated and manual editing. Automated methods were used in feature classification and duplicate detection. Manual editing was required both to confirm or provide a feature classification, but also to improve the spatial referencing.  Standards had to be adopted; for example water bodies were spatially located by a point which approximated its centre while rivers were spatially located at their termination and other liner features by a random point along their length. The former gives a useful spatial reference, the latter in many cases does not.  Quality checking suggests that 95% of points were located to 100m or better, and 5% located to 20m or better. More than 90% of features are classified correctly, on the basis of the evidence available","Source":"ckan API"},{"Title":"Planning Applications - Scotland","Owner":"Improvement Service","PageURL":" https:\/\/data.spatialhub.scot\/dataset\/planning_applications-is","AssetURL":"https:\/\/geo.spatialhub.scot\/geoserver\/sh_plapp\/wfs?service=wfs&typeName=sh_plapp:pub_plappweekpnt","FileName":"Planning Applications: Weekly Lists (Points)","DateCreated":"2021-06-11T09:21:48.757","DateUpdated":"2023-03-16T09:31:25.359","FileSize":null,"FileSizeUnit":"B","FileType":"WFS","NumRecords":null,"OriginalTags":"environment;planning","ManualTags":null,"License":"Other (Not Open)","Description":"'Development management' is the name given to the process of deciding planning applications and various other associated activities including enforcement of planning controls.

This layer can be filtered for individual year by selecting the 'shapefile' or 'GeoJSON' download option or the Web Feature Service can be filtered using appropriate software such as a desktop GIS.  This data is collected and published weekly (for weekly lists) and this metadata record is updated weekly.  We strongly recommend that, when using the WFS for this dataset, because of it's size you should use it with a filter.  *Moray's planning data has currently been removed from this dataset.

Planning technicians ensure that data is updated regularly once new information about a TPO is provided, a new TPO is registered or a TPO has been removed. The conservation officers or senior management advise and direct planning technicians to create a draft TPO location plan which is then sent to the paralegal team. The paralegals then carry out their duties in confirming and registering the TPO and informing any interested party. The planning technician then updates the spatial data in ArcMap which, once finalised, is then sent to GIS staff to update into Location Centre.

Every year the Scottish Government Communities Analytical Services produce a comprehensive national survey based on data collected and processed from all Local Authorities and Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park Authority.

Further consideration will be required to demonstrate that any significant effects on the qualities of these areas can be substantially overcome by siting, design or other mitigation.  National and international designations: \t\tWorld Heritage Sites; \t\tNatura 2000 and Ramsar sites; \t\tSites of Special Scientific Interest; \t\tNational Nature Reserves; \t\tSites identified in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes; \t\tSites identified in the Inventory of Historic Battlefields.  Other nationally important mapped environmental interests: \t\tareas of wild land as shown on the 2014 NatureScot map of wild land areas; \t\tcarbon rich soils, deep peat and priority peatland habitat.  Community separation for consideration of visual impact: an area not exceeding 2km around cities, towns and villages identified on the local development plan with an identified settlement envelope or edge. The extent of the area will be determined by the planning authority based on landform and other features which restrict views out from the settlement.  Group 3 - Area with potential for wind farm development:  Beyond groups 1 and 2, wind farms are likely to be acceptable, subject to detailed consideration against identified policy criteria. Reference should be made to Scottish Government planning and renewable energy policy.
